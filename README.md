itslib Legacy Library
=======================

This is an old c++ library I wrote for supporting my projects in the 2000s.
I was mostly writing code for Windows-CE back then.
Back then this was part of the itsutils windows-ce tools distribution.

My newer code all uses [cpputils](https://github.com/nlitsme/cpputils).
